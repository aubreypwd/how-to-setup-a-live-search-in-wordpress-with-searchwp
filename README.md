# How to Setup a "Live" Search in WordPress using SearchWP

Hi, my name is Aubrey Portwood and I work @WebDevStudios. I've been setting up SearchWP on some sites recently and I thought it would be really useful to know how to setup a popup-style "live" search using AJAX and SearchWP for the results.

## If you want to try the plugin out as you go...

First, you're going to need a WordPress install to install this plugin on (in order to use it).

Then, you're going to need to [download](https://github.com/aubreypwd/how-to-setup-a-live-search-in-wordpress-with-searchwp/archive/master.zip), install this plugin by uploading the Zip file via `Dashboard > Plugins > Add New > Upload`, and activate it.

Also, you'll need to download SearchWP from [http://searchwp.com](http://searchwp.com) via your Account tab and install and activate the plugin the same way.

### Setting up SearchWP

Once you got both plugins active you'll want to setup SearchWP, I've [made a neat video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WA3EAJCZd0) walking you through SearchWP and the above setup steps.
